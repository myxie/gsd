Getting Shit Done (_gsd_) is a patent-pending organisational system
designed to put up with all the organisational requirements of
a neo-post-modernist lifestyle.

_gsd_ is a project-based solution to task management that places the emphasis on compartmentalisation, in which tasks are assigned to a project. User are able to: 
* Add or remove projects
* Add tasks to projects
* Remove tasks from projects (this archives the task for future reference)
* List tasks assigned to all projects
* List tasks assigned to a particular project

Out of the box, a _gsd_ project will contain:
* A tasks.txt file, where all tasks are kept
* An archive.txt file, where all completed/removed tasks are put,and
* A links.txt file, for relevant links relevant to the project
 
Because of gsd's simplicity and local file management, the user can add any files or folders to their project directory in order to extend what is kept in the project. These could include: 
* A downloads directory
* Project description or READMEs
* Project attributes, such as images or rules for governing the project (in the event that projects are shared)
* Anything else!
